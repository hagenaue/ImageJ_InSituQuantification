# ImageJ_InSituQuantification
Designed for the Wakil lab, but could be adapted for other needs and laboratories

This .txt file contains code for a macro for the popular biological image analysis software ImageJ (http://imagej.net/Welcome). The macro makes it easier to quantify in situ hybridization autoradiographic images in a manner that automatically outputs a variety of (typically desired) measurements, including background measurements, area of the region of interest, signal thresholding, signal intensity (optical density), and area surpassing signal threshold, as well as all of their common derivitives (background-subtracted signal, integrated optical density, percentage of region of interest surpassing threshold, etc).
